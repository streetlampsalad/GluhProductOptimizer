# GluhProductOptimizer

### Design

Created PurchaseOrder and ProductPurchaseOrder models, ProductPurchaseOrder has the product on it and a list of PurchaseOrder. PurchaseOrder has all the details to the orders. I used recursion so I could manipulate the order of the list within the method, it also splits the logic accross smaller private methods.
